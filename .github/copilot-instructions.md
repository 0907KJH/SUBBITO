Project checklist (live status)

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created — File exists and is being updated.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements — Existing Vite + React + Tailwind project; no new scaffolding required.
- [x] Scaffold the Project — Skipped, project already initialized and populated.
- [x] Customize the Project — Implemented L‑R secondary (none/endfire/gradient/stack cardioid), PAN control, L‑R visual overhaul (rectangles, connecting lines with center distance, readable labels), Report tweaks (hide distance for L‑R, PAN note), and Stack Cardioid per‑side summary. Updated: L‑R + Gradient limited to 4 subs (one pair per side); rear inverted with delay = physical cone spacing/c.
- [x] Install Required Extensions — Skipped, none needed.
- [x] Compile the Project — Build OK (vite build) as of 2025‑11‑01.
- [x] Create and Run Task — Skipped, not necessary for this project unless requested.
- [x] Launch the Project — Dev server (Vite) used for live tests.
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete — README.md present; this file cleaned (HTML comments removed) and updated with current status.
 - [x] Centro Acustico — Implemented as a global offset where relevant: cardioid delays use DV_eff = DV − 2a; Y-positions adjusted for stack cardioid (front −a, rear +a); gradient/endfire left unchanged as they already use cone-to-cone geometry.

Guidelines
- Work through each checklist item systematically and keep updates concise.
- Update this file as tasks progress; prefer marking items with a brief completion note.
